         <h3>Isle of Skye</h3>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The Isle of Skye is the most beautiful island in Scotland that I had the pleasure of visiting. I was able to see the magnificent fairy pools and the fairy glen. I hiked the Quiraing, which is a truely unique experience with shifting fog and clarity to see the vast surroundings below. I also was able to see multiple waterfalls on the island during my 3 day stay.</p>

      <h3>Edinburgh</h3>
<p id="edinburghParagraph">Edinburgh is a lively city with alot of history, architecture, and cool adventures. My favorite sites were the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle, Victoria's Street, Greyfrair's Bobby statue, and Dean Village. I tried several Scottish foods/drinks in Edinburgh: vegetarian haggis, lorne sausage, Irn Bru 1901, English tea, and a Mars bar. The Irn Bru 1901 was almost as good as their recipe before the new sugar tax. It only costs 1&pound; at the Tesco Express stores. I was able to go to the Department of Magic to make smoking drinks and also tried butter beer there.</p>
<h4>Edinburgh Castle</h4>

<p id="edinburghParagraph">The Edinburgh Castle is a beautiful castle located in old town Edinburgh. To get the best photo of the castle, visit Ross Fountain in Prince Street Gardens. From here, the view covers the current construction being completed on the castle. You can walk at the bottom of the hill or take photos from a hop on hop off bus tour as well. Make sure to book a ticket in advance if you are planning to see inside the castle.</p>
<h4>Dolly at the National Museum of Scotland</h4>
<img src="C:\Users\mapoo\Desktop\LaunchCode\HTML-Me-Something-Start\images\Dolly.jpg" alt="Dolly the Sheep on display in the National Museum of Scotland" style="width:500px;height:300px;"/>
<p id="edinburghParagraph">The National Museum of Scotland has many very interesting and fun things to see. The image above is Dolly, the first successfully cloned sheep. The museum had a Lego version of the museum, which was very cool. There were many interactive displays including a pedal powered propeller, fitting bolt head style blocks into the correct spot, and games of concentration or speed. The museum housed many items and jewelry of Mary Queen of Scots. You could also see examples of the clothes that were worn by the Scottish in the 1800s.</p>
<h4>Dean Village</h4>
<img src="C:\Users\mapoo\Desktop\LaunchCode\HTML-Me-Something-Start\images\Dean Village.jpeg" alt="Dean village homes with a stream between the homes" style="width:400px;height:550px;"/>
<p id="edinburghParagraph">Dean Village is a cute little village in Edinburgh that you can easily access using the bus system. The Waters of Leith cuts right through the center of multiple homes and buildings. If you walk along the water on the pathway for about 5 minutes, you will see a waterfall. The Waters of Leith is about a 13 mile long and can be an enjoyable stroll.</p>
